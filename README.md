# air-pollution---project-1
Air pollution real-time data analysis (Madrid, January-May 2022)
The main idea of this analysis is to get a picture of a couple of air pollutants - detrimental to human health. Having this on file one could organize hers/his time outdoors for sports, commuting by foot, bike or scooter, avoiding the air pollution peaks. Hopefully it will make sense to all who love Madrid and like to spend time outdoors.
This project used the following data source: https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.c05c1f754a33a9fbe4b2e4b284f1a5a0/?vgnextoid=41e01e007c9db410VgnVCM2000000c205a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=374512b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default
The analysis includes all measuring stations, subsequently zooming into contrasting couples e.g. central vs. suburban areas.
In a second stage the analysis will zoom into all stations or city areas. Third stage will cover areas adjacent to Madrid city.
